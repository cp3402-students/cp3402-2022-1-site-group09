# Applicaion and Process 

A variety of applications, programs and environments are used and deployed for our website . The websites for each will be included down below.

# Theme Developments 

[VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)  : VScode is used as the coding platform.It is a  source-code editor made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. The codes edited include ( CSS, PHP and HTML)

[Underscore](https://underscores.me/): The Starter Theme used for the Theme development is from underscore.me . It is a highly rated base theme template that is highly recommended in github. 

# Hosting and Deployment

[AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/): Amazon Web Servers was used to host the final production site of the website . Made by amazon they provide free web hosting with 1 click wordpress setup features .Though the setup process can be a bit challenging it is a highly respected web server that fully provides the database, free IP and also several tutorials for beginners.

[Local](https://localwp.com/):  Local is a local host app that is very simple and easy to use for the beginners. Unlike Xampp, you do not have to download and set up wordpress. Instead they have the wordpress builder built into their app and all you have to do is to click “create a website” to start working on your local host without having to create your database as it does automatically. The diverse menu also allows you to go directly to the files affiliated to your website without having to search them in you local drive folders 

# Project Management 

[Discord](https://discord.com/): Discord is used as our primary source of communication with the team. We set up our weekly meeting and share our links and passwords for various websites via discord .

[Github](https://github.com/): Github acts as our Version Control and serves as a platform to share the code we are developing . It is a very popular platform that is very user friendly as there are several tutorials regarding github out there. We set up a repository where we keep track of the changes made in the codes.

[Trello](https://trello.com/en) : Trello acted as the wordboard of the entire process. It is very user friendly and Trello can be immensely useful to keep track of the remaining tasks and can be used as a tool for division of labor among members. It can be used to set due dates for when a task need to be accomplished for time management.

# Environment Overview

Firstly the underscore theme template was uploaded into the github repository and then each member downloaded them into their own local host wordpress using LOCAL . There they worked on the theme and committed the major changes they made back into github. This was repeated until the team was satisfied with the custom theme.

## Hosted Environment ( Production Site )

The finished theme folder is then uploaded into the hosting server AWS which supports Wordpress.All the changes that were made in the Staging area are uploaded into the Production site.
