#Project Management 

Discord: Discord is used as our primary source of communication with the team. We set up our weekly meeting and share our links and passwords for various websites via discord .

Github: Github acts as our Version Control and serves as a platform to share the code we are developing . It is a very popular platform that is very user friendly as there are several tutorials regarding github out there. We set up a repository where we keep track of the changes made in the codes.

Trello : Trello acted as the wordboard of the entire process. It is very user friendly and Trello can be immensely useful to keep track of the remaining tasks and can be used as a tool for division of labor among members. It can be used to set due dates for when a task need to be accomplished for time management.

#Environment Overview

##Local Environment (Staging site )

Firstly the underscore theme template was uploaded into the github repository and then each member downloaded them into their own local host wordpress using LOCAL . There they worked on the theme and committed the major changes they made back into github. This was repeated until the team was satisfied with the custom theme.

##Hosted Environment ( Production Site )

The finished theme folder is then uploaded into the hosting server AWS which supports Wordpress.All the changes that were made in the Staging area are uploaded into the Production site. There we worked on the website for our client Baizoon. We then update the website using plugins , widgets, forms and much more until the group is satisfied.
