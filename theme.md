# Introduction
  In order to get a personalized experience in using wordpress, a fully customizable theme made from scratch is the best way.  So it is a pleasure to introduce  the theme created by group 9  which is called "Baizonn".  The following sections provide details about the theme and more importantly the theme development process workflow.

# Theme Origin & Tools Used
  The code base we used was the Underscores.me (https://underscores.me/) as it is a very plain theme and also recommended in the project guide.
  
  We used Visual Studio (https://code.visualstudio.com/) to code and tweak the theme to our liking. VS is simple to use and user-friendly. Aside from that, the VS community also supports connection to a version control service like Github which we used to commit our code.
  
# Theme Design Details
  For our overall theme we went for a minimal theme that is easy on the eyes and simple to navigate- even for the least experienced technology users. The different aspects of the theme are as follows:
 
## Full-width layout
  For users who do not want a side bar on their page or post, we have created two layout templates: template-fullwidth.php and single-nosidebar.php. The post editor in wp-admin allows the user to easily change the template.

## Typography
  We have used a large variety of fonts mainly chosen through a criteria of Readability > Aesthetics > Scaling. The result is well-fitting fonts for the different cases they are implemented in.
